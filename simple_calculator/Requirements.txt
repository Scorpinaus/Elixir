Requirements and structure:
- Command-line interface
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
- Should take user input for numbers and operations.
- Should display the result of the calculation.

Updates
- 11/9: Basic calculator functionality set-up

Future Additions:
1. Add more complex mathematical operations:
Implement functions for exponents, square roots, or trigonometric operations.

2. Create a loop for multiple calculations:
Modify the calculate function to allow users to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

3. Enhance error handling:
Add more robust error checking for invalid operations or inputs.

4. Implement a command-line interface:
Create options for users to choose operations or exit the program.

5. Store calculation history:
Keep a record of past calculations and allow users to recall them.

6. Use Elixir's Mix tool:
Convert your project into a Mix project, which is the standard way to organize Elixir projects.

7. Write tests:
Learn about ExUnit, Elixir's built-in test framework, and write tests for your calculator functions.
